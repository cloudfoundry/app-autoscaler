            There are two different scaling types:
              + 0: This represents `ScalingTypeDynamic`. The scaling has been done due to a dynamic
                  scaling rule, reacting on metrics provided by the app.
              + 1: This represents `ScalingTypeSchedule`. The scaling has been done due to a
                  scheduled period changing the default instance limits.
