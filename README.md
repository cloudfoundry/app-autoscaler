# App-AutoScaler [![Build Status](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/actions/workflows/postgres.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/actions/workflows/postgres.yaml) [![Build Status](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/actions/workflows/mysql.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/actions/workflows/mysql.yaml)

The `App-AutoScaler` provides the capability to adjust the computation resources for Cloud Foundry applications through

* Dynamic scaling based on application performance metrics
* Scheduled scaling based on time

The `App-AutoScaler` has the following components:

* `api` : provides public APIs to manage scaling policy
* `servicebroker`: implements the [Cloud Foundry service broker API][k]
* `metricsgateway` : collects and filters loggregator events via loggregator v2  API
* `metricsserver`: transforms loggregator events to app-autoscaler performance metrics ( metricsgateway + metricsserver is a replacement of metricscollector)
* `metricsforwarder`: receives and forwards custom metrics to loggreator via v2 ingress API
* `eventgenerator`: aggreates memory metrics, evaluates scaling rules and triggers events for dynamic scaling
* `scheduler`: manages the schedules in scaling policy and trigger events for scheduled scaling
* `scalingengine`: takes the scaling actions based on dynamic scaling rules or schedules

You can follow the development progress on [Pivotal Tracker][t].

## Development
 
### System requirements

* Java 11 or above
* Docker
* [Apache Maven][b] 3
* [Cloud Foundry cf command line][f]
* Go 1.15 or above

### Database requirement

The `App-AutoScaler` supports Postgres and MySQL. It uses Postgres as the default backend 
data store. These are run up locally with docker images so ensure that docker is working on 
your system before running up the tests.

### Setup

To set up the development, firstly clone this project

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler.git
```

Generate [scheduler test certs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/app-autoscaler/blob/main/scheduler/README.md#generate-certificates)


#### Initialize the Database

* **Postgres**
```shell
make init-db
```

* **MySQL**
```shell
make init-db db_type=mysql
```


#### Generate TLS Certificates
create the certificates

**Note**: on macos it will install `certstrap` automatically but on other OS's it needs to be pre-installed
```shell
make test-certs
```


#### Install consul
To be able to run unit tests and integration tests, you'll need to install consul binary.
```
if uname -a | grep Darwin; then os=darwin; else os=linux; fi
curl -L -o $TMPDIR/consul-0.7.5.zip "https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/0.7.5/consul_0.7.5_${os}_amd64.zip"
unzip $TMPDIR/consul-0.7.5.zip -d $GOPATH/bin
rm $TMPDIR/consul-0.7.5.zip
```

### Unit tests

* **Postgres**:
```shell
make test
```

* **MySQL**:
```shell
make test db_type=mysql
```

### Integration tests

**Postgres**
```shell
make integration
```

**MySQL**:
```shell
make test db_type=mysql
```

### Build App-AutoScaler
```shell
make build
```

### Clean up
You can use the  `make clean` to remove:

* database ( postgres or mysql)
* autoscaler build artifacts

### Coding Standards
Autoscaler uses Golangci and Checkstyle for its code base. Refer to [style-guide](style-guide/README.md)

## Deploy and offer Auto-Scaler as a service

Go to [app-autoscaler-release][r] project for how to BOSH deploy `App-AutoScaler`

## Use Auto-Scaler service

Refer to [user guide][u] for the details of how to use the Auto-Scaler service, including policy definition, supported metrics, public API specification and command line tool.
